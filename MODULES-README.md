# Setting up Modules XML

The file `modules.xml` is key to defining what gets built to create this course.  It defines:

  * The labs to include
  * The lab-instructions to include
  * The instructor presentations to include, numbering them in order

Full details on how to configure and use `modules.xml` can be found in
[common-build/MODULES-README.md](https://github.com/S2EDU/common-build/blob/master/MODULES-README.md)
